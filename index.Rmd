### Population Projections
### for the UK

<br>

* 'Demography is destiny' according to Auguste Comte, or maybe Wattenberg and Scammon (1970).

* The app computes population projections for the United Kingdom for 2015-50 using forecasts of total fertility selected by the user. It can produce a population pyramid for the mid- or end-point of any decade in this period that the user selects.

* Thereby, it enables the user to visualize how women's changing family sizes might affect the future size and age structure of the British population.
