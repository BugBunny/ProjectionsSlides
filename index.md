### Population Projections
### for the UK

* The assignment was to code and deploy an interactive web app using the R package _shiny_.

* 'Demography is destiny' according to Auguste Comte, or maybe Wattenberg and Scammon (1970).

* This app computes population projections for the United Kingdom for 2015-50 using forecasts of total fertility chosen by the user. It can produce a population pyramid for the mid- or end-point of any decade within this period that the user selects.

* Thereby, it enables the user to visualize how changes in the birth rate might affect the future size and age structure of the British population.

### A ___static___ population pyramid




```r
library(plotrix); par(mar = pyramid.plot(Men, Women, gap = 250,  
   lxcol = "steelblue", rxcol = "plum", unit = "000s", labels = agelab,
   main = "United Kingdom", top.labels = c("Men", "2015", "Women")))
```

### The power of _shiny_

<br>

<p style="text-align: left;"> The app demonstrates several features of <em>shiny:</em></p>

<br>

* <div class="fragment"> Panelled web page layouts, including tabbed panels</div>
* <div class="fragment"> Use of widgets for input (sliders, dropdown boxes)</div>
* <div class="fragment"> Reactive code that runs if the sliders change, but not when the dropdown box does</div>
* <div class="fragment"> Two types of reactive output (text and a chart)</div>
* <div class="fragment"> Web hosting on the shiny apps server</div>

### Accessing the app and the code

<br>

The app is hosted on _RStudio_'s shiny apps server:
